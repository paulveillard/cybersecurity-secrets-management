## What Are Secrets?

Secrets are environment dependent configurations that need to be kept secret and should be read only by subjects with a need-to-know. Secrets are digital authentication credentials such as:
- Passwords, 
- SSH keys, 
- API keys, 
- AWS IAM/STS Credentials, 
- Database passwords (SQL/NoSQL), 
- X.509 certificates like TLS/SSL certificates or private certificates, 
- Tokens, 
- Locks (encryption keys), 
- Privileged credentials, and other secrets.

### Why Store Secrets?
 Storing secrets the secure way is a challenge with limiting access and a true secure storage.
 
### How do you store secrets
Passwords, API keys, secure Tokens, and confidential data fall into the category of secrets. That’s data which shouldn’t lie around. It mustn’t be available in plaintext in easy to guess locations. In fact, it must not be stored in plaintext in any location.

## What Are Secrets Management?

Secrets Management Centrally Manage Secrets to Reduce Secrets Sprawl.


## Secret Management Tools
Secrets management tools replace fragmented and manual secrets management and provide central visibility, oversight, and management of a company’s credentials, keys, and other secrets across departments. Most commonly, these tools are used by software developers, security professionals, and IT operations teams (DevOps or DevSecOps).


> [Secrets Management Tools](https://www.g2.com/categories/secrets-management-tools)  are similar to but more robust than encryption key management software, which focuses on the storage, use, and rotation of encryption keys. Similarly, there is an overlap between secrets management and privileged access management (PAM) software. While security-focused PAM solutions offer secrets management, they also offer more robust security functions for enforcing least privilege policies with access controls, monitoring and recording privileged sessions, and alerting suspicious activity. Some secrets management solutions are built into platforms or cloud providers directly. In contrast, other solutions augment that functionality by offering a universal and centralized approach to secrets management, regardless of platform, using integrations.

To qualify for the Secrets Management category, a product must:
- Centrally manage keys and other secrets
- Securely store secrets with encryption and tokenization
- Automate pushing secrets to applications and infrastructure
- Create audit trail of secrets use and lifecycle
